# Heimdall Mark I
The goal of this project is to create my own quadcopter using a modified version of the open source MultiWii flight control software.
As this project is still under development, I haven't taken the time to do a full write up of the parts and processes involved, but 
once it is complete I will provide those in case someone wanted to recreate and/or improve my project.
